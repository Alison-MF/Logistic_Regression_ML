# Logistic_Regression_ML

This repository contains the Logistic Regression, QLearning and Linear Regression libraries, as well as the Python script for extracting CSV files generated by Simu5G.
All simulations were performed on Linux platforms.

Below is the link to download the modified Simu5G, along with the Handover project for access:
